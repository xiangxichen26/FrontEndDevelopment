            The poodle is a group of formal dog breeds, the Standard Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle. The origin of the breed is still discussed, with a prominent dispute over whether the poodle descends from Germany as a type of water dog, or from the French Barbet.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

            Ranked second most intelligent dog breed just behind the Border Collie, the poodle is skillful in many dog sports and activities, including agility, obedience, tracking to herding, circus performers or assistance dogs. Poodles have taken top honors in many conformation shows, including "Best in Show" at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1991 and 2002, and at the World Dog Show in 2007 and 2010. The poodle is an active, intelligent and elegant dog, squarely built, and well proportioned. To ensure the desirable squarely built appearance, the length of body measured from the breastbone to the point of the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground. The eyes should be very dark, oval in shape, and have an alert and intelligent expression. The ears should fold over close to the head, set at, or slightly below, eye level. The coat should be of naturally curly texture. The coat is an even and solid color at the skin. In blues, grays, silvers, browns, cafe-au-laits, apricots and creams the coat may show varying shades of the same color. This is frequently present in Parti Poodles.

            Toy Poodles won "Best in Show" at Crufts in 1966 and 1982. The 2002 winner came from Norway and was the first overseas exhibit to win the Crufts best in show award. The Standard Poodle, at 15 inches and over, is the oldest of the three varieties, and was known as a hunting dog specialized in retrieving waterfowl. The smaller Miniature Poodle was used for truffle hunting in France. The Toy Poodle was often used in performances and circuses.
